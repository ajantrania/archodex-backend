# Specification Quality Checklist: Account Plans & Rate Limiting

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-10
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**All Clarifications Resolved**:

1. **Cached Limit Expiration for Self-Hosted**: RESOLVED - 3 days (72 hours) cache validity
2. **Plan Downgrade Behavior**: RESOLVED - Graceful degradation (existing resources remain, new resources dropped)
3. **Partial Batch Handling**: RESOLVED - Honor batch atomicity (accept full batch if started before limit)

**Additional Requirements Added**:
- FR-023/FR-024: Plan limits must be embedded in report API keys with cryptographic protection
- New User Story 4: Transmit Plan Limits to Agents (Priority P2)
- Detailed edge cases for API key limit representation and plan change handling

**Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan`**
