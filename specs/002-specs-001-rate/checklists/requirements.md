# Specification Quality Checklist: Testing Framework Setup and Validation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-14
**Updated**: 2025-10-14 (final revision - approach-agnostic, mocking viable, CI clarified)
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (framework selection is Open Question to be resolved in Phase 0)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Summary**: All checklist items pass validation after making specification framework-agnostic.

**Specification Quality Assessment**:
- ✅ Content is focused on WHAT and WHY (testing approach evaluation and setup), not HOW
- ✅ All 29 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- ✅ Success criteria include specific metrics (4-8 hours eval, 30 seconds, 5 seconds, 3 minutes, 2-3 days, etc.)
- ✅ Success criteria are technology-agnostic and approach-agnostic
- ✅ 4 prioritized user stories: approach evaluation, setup, validation, and CI integration
- ✅ Scope correctly excludes rate limiting tests (those belong in feature 001-rate-limits-we)
- ✅ Edge cases cover approach evaluation, SurrealDB testing, and complexity tradeoffs
- ✅ Scope clearly defined with "Out of Scope" section explicitly noting rate limiting tests and deployed backend testing
- ✅ Dependencies include Archodex SurrealDB fork info and mockall as viable option
- ✅ Assumptions clarified: tests never run against deployed backends
- ✅ Risks address approach selection, SurrealDB testability, and maintenance burden
- ✅ Timeline includes Phase 0 for approach and SurrealDB research (4-8 hours)
- ✅ Open Questions explicitly call out three-level decision process and emphasize mocking as viable
- ✅ CI requirements specify GitHub Actions + ACT for local testing

**Key Changes Across All Iterations**:

**Iteration 1 - Framework Agnostic**:
- **Added User Story 1**: Testing approach evaluation and selection (Priority P1)
- **Renumbered User Stories**: Infrastructure setup (P1), Validation (P1), CI Integration (P2)
- **Updated Functional Requirements**: Added FR-001 through FR-004 for approach evaluation
- **Updated Success Criteria**: Added SC-001 through SC-004 for approach selection
- **Updated Dependencies**: Split into pre-selection and post-selection with potential options listed
- **Updated Timeline**: Added Phase 0 for 4-hour approach evaluation before implementation
- **Updated Open Questions**: Approach selection is now explicit open question to resolve in Phase 0
- **Removed prescriptive framework choices**: No longer assumes testcontainers or specific tools

**Iteration 2 - Pragmatic Approach Evaluation**:
- **Refocused from "framework" to "approach"**: Changed from selecting tools to evaluating testing strategies
- **Added FR-005**: Team MUST evaluate pragmatic testing approaches (unit/integration/hybrid)
- **Added FR-006**: Team MUST evaluate SurrealDB testing options (Archodex fork, in-memory, mocking)
- **Updated User Story 1**: Focus on approach evaluation, not just framework selection
- **Updated Edge Cases**: Added complexity tradeoff considerations
- **Updated Open Questions**: Added three-level decision process (approach → SurrealDB → tools)
- **Updated Timeline Phase 0**: Extended to 4-8 hours to include SurrealDB research
- **Made all requirements approach-agnostic**: No assumptions about integration vs unit tests

**Iteration 3 - Final Clarifications**:
- **Updated User Story 3 acceptance scenarios**: Made approach-agnostic (no database verification assumptions)
- **Updated FR-016 and FR-017**: Validation appropriate to chosen approach (function logic or database state)
- **Removed/replaced FR-026**: Cleanup only for test resources, never deployed backends
- **Updated all CI references**: Changed "GitHub Actions or AWS CodeBuild" to "GitHub Actions + ACT"
- **Added Archodex SurrealDB fork**: Added GitHub URL and local path to dependencies
- **Moved mockall from Out of Scope**: Now listed as viable first-class option in dependencies
- **Added assumption**: Tests never run against deployed backends
- **Emphasized mocking in Open Questions**: Mocking is viable first-class option (simplest, fastest, reduces complexity)

**Feature Purpose**: This feature evaluates pragmatic testing approaches (unit with mocks vs integration with DB vs hybrid), researches SurrealDB testing viability, selects approach that fits project stage and maintenance burden (per Constitution), and validates with 2 example tests for existing features. Selection is data-driven, considers tradeoffs, and is stakeholder-approved.

**Key Focus Areas**:
- Testing approach selection (unit/integration/hybrid - not just framework/tooling)
- SurrealDB testing research (Archodex DDB-backed fork, in-memory, embedded, mocking viability)
- Mocking as first-class viable option (simplest, fastest, reduces infrastructure complexity)
- Pragmatism over perfection (maintenance burden, setup complexity, developer adoption)
- Constitution alignment (acceptable complexity for current project stage)
- CI/local testing with GitHub Actions + ACT
- Never testing against deployed backends (point-in-time restoration if using test databases)

**Readiness**: Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase.
