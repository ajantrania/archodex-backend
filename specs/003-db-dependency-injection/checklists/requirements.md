# Specification Quality Checklist: Database Dependency Injection for Testing

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items pass. The specification is ready for planning phase (`/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify`).

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear problem definition based on existing blocker (T036)
- Well-defined user stories with priorities
- Concrete acceptance scenarios for each story
- Technology-agnostic success criteria (focused on test outcomes, performance, isolation)
- Edge cases identified
- Scope is bounded to dependency injection architecture change

**Assumptions Made**:
- Production code will continue using global connection pooling (no change to performance characteristics)
- Tests will use in-memory SurrealDB as established in 002-specs-001-rate/research.md
- `#[cfg(test)]` guards will be used appropriately to exclude test-specific code from release builds
- Account struct can be extended to hold optional injected connections without breaking existing code

**Dependencies**:
- Depends on test framework established in 002-specs-001-rate (test helpers, in-memory DB setup)
- Requires understanding of Account and DBConnection architecture (src/account.rs, src/db.rs)
- Must maintain compatibility with both archodex-com and self-hosted deployment models
